"Have To" and "Must"

These two are very similar and both are used to talk about obligation.

Used in the positive/affirmative, these two are almost identical. They are used to say that there is an obligation, necessity for someone to do something.

Drivers in England have to drive on the left of the road.
All students must finish the exam by eleven o'clock.
All young Israelis have to do military service.

Usually, have to is used when there is an external obligation on you, must when the obligation comes from the speaker.

Note the difference:

It's late, I'm really tired, I must go now. Bye!
It's late. I'd love to stay but I have a meeting tomorrow morning. I have to go now. Bye!

Note the construction:

Subject	+	Have to
Must	+	Infinitive without "TO"
NOT I must to go home before midnight.


Used in the negative, have to and must are very different.
Mustn't means there is an obligation not to do something. It's against the law, for example.

You mustn't drive over 70mph in this area.
Teachers mustn't hit their students.
If you drink more than a couple of beers, you mustn't try and drive home.

Don't have to, on the other hand, means there is no obligation for you to do something. In other words, it isn't necessary.

Rich people don't have to work.
You don't have to do part B of the test. That is for the other class.
In Britain, old people don't have to pay on the buses. It's free!

Must doesn't have a past form so you should use had to.
