Twelve Days of Christmas

The Twelve days of Christmas is a song where each verse is built on top of the previous verses.

The song starts: On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me a partridge in a pear tree.

It then adds the next verse and repeats the last one: On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree. This continues by adding the other verses one at a time.

You will notice that each verse is a gift that was received by the true love of the person who is singing.

The twelve verses are as follows:

12 drummers drumming
11 pipers piping
10 lords-a-leaping
9 ladies dancing
8 maids-a-milking
7 swans-a-swimming
6 geese-a-laying
5 golden rings
4 calling birds
3 French hens
2 turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree.

Different Versions
This Christmas song was created around 1780 and has had a few changes over the centuries.

The original version uses 5 gold rings though nowadays 5 golden rings is more common due to the extra syllable that is sung to continue with the same rhythm.

The original version mentions 4 colly birds. Back then, colly was another way of saying black and they were most likely referring to blackbirds. However the word came into disuse over the years and since 1909 has been replaced by 4 calling birds.

Some versions use my true love sent to me instead of gave to me.
