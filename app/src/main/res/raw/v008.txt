Using Die, Died and Dead

No, I'm not trying to talk about a strange subject. It is just that I have heard a lot of people use these words wrong. So I would like to give you some help so you can make sure to always use them right.

The picture to the left is of dice. One piece is called a die, more than one are called dice. We use dice to play games.
Die is also a verb. It is the base form of the verb and present tense. It means when a life is finished. So, you could say- Someday everyone will die. Or I don't want to die.

The past tense of die is died. You could say The dog died. Or My grandfather died last year.

Dead is an adjective. It describes a noun. For example- That is a dead mouse. Or The monster is dead.

Note: Another (more polite or respectful) way to say die is pass away. For example, instead of saying My grandfather died last year, you could say My grandfather passed away last year.
