A/an and one

We use a before words that begin with a consonant sound. Some words start with a vowel letter but begin with a consonant sound, so we use a before these words, too:  a university (lo ju:n.../) a European (/a juar.../) a one-parent family (/a WAII.../) We use an before words that begin with a vowel sound:  an orange an Italian an umbrella These include words that begin with a silent letter 'h':  an hour an honest child an honour an heir (= a person who inherits money etc., when someone dies) rtand abbreviations said as individual letters that begin with A, E, F, H, I, L, M, N, O, R, S or X:   an MP (Ion em pi:/) an FBI agent (/an ef bi: ai.../) an IOU (/an ai ao jo:/) But compare abbreviations said as words:  a NATO general (lo neitau.../) a FIFA official (/a fi:fa.../)
D We can use a/an before singular countable nouns (see also Unit 50). Sometimes we can use either a/an or one:  We'll be in Australia for one (or a) year.  Wait here for one (or a) minute, and I'll be with you.  She scored one (or a) hundred and eighty points. Using one in sentences like these gives a little more emphasis to the number.
However, we use one rather than a/an if we want to emphasise that we are talking about only one thing or person rather than two or more:  Do you want one sandwich or two?  Are you staying just one night?  I just took one look at her and she started crying. We use one, not a/an in the pattern one...other / another:  Close one eye, and then the other.  Bees carry pollen from one plant to another. We also use one in phrases such as one day, one evening, one spring, etc., to mean a particular, but unspecified day, evening, spring, etc.:  Hope to see you again one day.  One evening, while he was working late at the office ...
' We don't use one when we mean 'any one of a particular type of thing':  I really need a cup of coffee, (not... one cup of coffee.)  You can never find a paper clip in this office, (not ...one paper clip) We also use a/an, not one, in number and quantity expressions such as: fy  three times a year half an hour a quarter of an hour a day or so (= about a day)   50 pence a (= each) litre (notice we can also say '...for one litre')  a week or two (= somewhere between one and two weeks; notice we can also say 'one or two weeks')  a few a little a huge number of... We use a rather than one in the pattern a...of... with possessives, as in:  She's a colleague of mine.  That's a friend of Bill's.
