Modal Verbs

Modal verbs are irregular auxiliary verbs (they don't have regular past and present forms, for example) that express ability, necessity, requests, advice, permission, probability and so on. They are generally used with other verbs in the infinitive:

(See the next sections for modal verbs "will" and "must/mustn't".)

I must go to the hotel tomorrow.
They can be very selfish!
We should leave now.

There are modal verbs which have different meanings and different functions.

Should / Shouldn't

This is used to give advice or to express what you expect.

Examples:

You should go to the doctor if your headaches continue.
They should win the championship this year. They are the best team.



We use "shouldn't" to talk about something you are advising a person not to do.

Examples:

If you want to pass your exams, you shouldn't go out tonight.
You shouldn't speak to your mother like that - show some respect!

May / Might

These are similar in meaning and are used to express possibility.

Examples:

Q: Are you going to the cinema tonight?
A: I don't know. I might go or I might stay at home.

Used in questions, these two are ways of asking for something in a polite/formal way.

Might I borrow your telephone for a few moments?
May I open the window a little, please?

Can / Could

We have already seen that "can" can be used to talk about ability, with "could" used in the past:
Examples:

I can see, but I can't dance.
Could you speak French from a young age?
My mum couldn't swim until she was 24!

We can also use "can" to talk about possibility, permission and make polite requests:

Examples:

I can't come to the party tonight. (possibility)
You can't go in there! (permission)
Can you help me with this package? (request)
Could you lend me ten dollars? (polite request)

Note that all three of these modal verbs are followed directly by an infinitive verb without "to".
