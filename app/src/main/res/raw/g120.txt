Subject And Object Questions

Look at this sentence:

Mary looked at somebody.

Here, "somebody" is the object of the question. We want to know who the "somebody" is so we ask the question:

Who did Mary look at?

Now look at this sentence:

Somebody looked at Mary.

Now, "somebody" is the subject of the sentence. If we want to know who the "somebody" is, we have to ask:

Who looked at Mary?

When we use who, what or which as the subject of a question, we don't use do, does or did.
