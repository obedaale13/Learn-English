Relative Pronouns and Relative Clauses

Here are three pieces of information.

There is a man. He lives next to the bank. He is a postman.

Now, we can join these three sentences together using a relative pronoun:

The man who lives next to the bank is a postman.

A relative clause is part of a sentence which tells us more information about a person or thing. Here are three other sentences.

There is a restaurant. We went there last night. It was very expensive.

Which we can combine using a different relative pronoun:

The restaurant where we went last night was very expensive.

We can use different relative pronouns depending if we are talking about a person, a place or a possession.

The man whose car was stolen last night is at the police station.
The town where Copernicus was born also invented gingerbread.
The politician who won the election was a communist.
The dog that/which bit me was a labrador.

Now look at these sentences.

You looked at a girl. She was blonde.
A girl looked at you. She was blonde.

In the first pair of sentences, the blonde girl is the object of the sentence. In the second pair of sentences, the blonde girl is the subject. When we use relative pronouns to join sentences like this, we don't have to include the relative pronoun that is the object:

You looked at a girl. She was blonde. (object)
We can write: The girl you looked at was blonde.

but

A girl looked at you. She was blonde. (subject)
We must write: The girl who looked at you was blonde.

We have to include the relative pronoun if it is the subject of a sentence.

The restaurant you like is near the bank. (relative pronoun omitted - object)
The restaurant which opens late is near the bank. (relative pronoun included - subject)
