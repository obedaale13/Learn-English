Past Continuous Use

The past continuous has two main uses:

To describe an event that was happening in the past at the time of another event. Often the first event interrupts the second event. In this situation, the event that started first is in the past continuous and the second event is in the past simple:

I was watching TV when the telephone rang.
He left university while he was finishing his final year.

We can also use the past continuous to give the background to a story. The events of this story are in the past simple.

He walked out of the bank with the gun. Police were standing surrounding the bank. A large crowd were watching events from the "Police" barricades. A helicopter was flying overhead. He raised his gun to fire at the police and..and..he woke up. It was 7am and time for work.

If there are two events that happen simultaneously, they can either be in the past continuous or simple.

Mary was cutting the onions while I was cooking the beef.
