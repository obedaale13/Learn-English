Listening - Student Conversations

In the TOEFL exam you will often hear conversations between two students about something related to campus life. In the iBT version of TOEFL, these conversations not only appear in the listening section but also as a part of the integrated questions of the Speaking Section.
Since these conversations are in a more informal style (compared to the more correct style in academic lectures), you need to know a lot of vocabulary that is more relaxed and natural, as would appear in real life. Notice how some of the expressions are idiomatic.
