Comparative and Superlative Adjectives

Comparative adjectives compare two things. Superlative adjectives compare more than two things

Commonly, adjectives that contain only one syllable or end in 'y' use 'er' to form comparatives and 'est' to form superlatives. For adjectives ending in y, change the 'y' to 'i' before adding the 'er' or 'est'.

old – older – oldest
young – younger – youngest
pretty – prettier – prettiest
long – longer – longest
short – shorter – shortest
bright – brighter – brightest
close – closer – closest
happy – happier - happiest
Adjectives with two or more syllables do not change but instead add more to form comparatives and most to form superlatives.

respectable – more respectable – most respectable
beautiful – more beautiful – most beautiful
preferable – more preferable – most preferable
hardworking – more hardworking – most hardworking
Some adjectives have different forms of comparatives and superlatives.

good – better – best
bad – worse – worst
little – less – least
much (many) – more – most
far – further - furthest
