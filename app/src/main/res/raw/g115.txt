Past Perfect Use

We use the past perfect to talk about something that happened before another event in the past. It's like a double past.

Take this sentence in the past simple.

I arrived home at about 6 o'clock and sat down on the sofa to watch the big football game.

Poor John doesn't realise that the television doesn't work. Why doesn't the TV work? The TV exploded at 5pm - one hour before he arrived home:

His wife explained that the TV had exploded at 5pm.

Look at these two sentences. What is the difference?

When John arrived home, his wife cooked dinner.
When John arrived home, his wife had cooked dinner.

In the first, we use past simple and past simple for a sequence of events in the past. So his wife waited for John to arrive home, then started cooking dinner.

In the second sentence, "his wife had cooked dinner" tells us that this had happened before John arrived. It means the dinner was waiting for John on the table when he arrived.

So we can use the past perfect to make it clear that something had happened before something else.

She failed her exams because she hadn't studied.

We could also write:

She failed her exams because she didn't study.

But using the past perfect emphasises the fact that she hadn't studied before the exam.

The past perfect is often used, therefore, to talk about the reasons for a past situation.

She was crying because Philip had written her a terrible letter.
He was late because he had missed his train.
They felt sick as they had eaten too much.
