'For', 'Since' and 'Ago'

We can use for or since with the present perfect to say how long something has happened.

I have known him since 1980.
or
I have known him for 22 years.

The meaning is the same. For is used to talk about a period of time, since to talk about when the action started.

ago is more often used with the past simple to say when something started.

He started his own business six months ago.
The first book was printed over 500 years ago.

So the difference between 'since' and 'ago'?

Since tells us the starting point of an action which is still continuing now. Ago tells us the starting point of an action which is finished.

I have lived in this city since 1980.
I left Denver to come here over twenty years ago.
