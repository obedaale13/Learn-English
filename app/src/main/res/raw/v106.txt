Trick or Treat
Trick or treat is the term used for children being dressed in costumes and going from house to house asking for candy. The children usually knock on the neighbor's door and say:

"Trick or Treat. Trick or Treat. Give me something good to eat!"
Trick is the supposed threat that something bad (or mischievous) will happen to the person if they do not receive a treat (a candy, sweets or something similar). Of course kids normally don't do anything bad. Parents often walk around the streets with their kids to make sure nothing bad happens.
