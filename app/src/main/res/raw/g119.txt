Needn't

We use needn't in the same way as we use don't have to. It means something is not necessary.

You needn't come with us. You can stay at home if you want.
I needn't bring my umbrella, it will be a lovely day.

We use needn't have for something that wasn't necessary in the past:

I needn't have come to school today! There is a teachers' strike!!
The car wasn't dirty - you needn't have washed it!

Needn't have, as in the two sentences above, tells us something in the past that wasn't necessary in the past, but we did it. We can use "didn't need to" to say what wasn't necessary in the past that we knew before wasn't necessary.

It was Sunday yesterday and I wasn't working so I didn't need to get up early.

Compare these two situations:

I bought 2kg of sugar yesterday but my wife tells me now that we have a lot of sugar already so I needn't have bought the new bag. It was my mistake because I didn't check first.

I bought 2kg of sugar yesterday. I knew we had some sugar and that I didn't need to buy more but this new bag was on special offer at the supermarket so I bought it anyway.
