'Will' or 'Going To'
We have already discussed the use of "going to" to talk about the future. It is used to talk about plans already made and also to make predictions based on evidence we see now.

We will now talk about "will" and then see how they differ in direct comparison.

Will is a modal verb and is followed directly by an infinitive verb without "to".

I will see you tomorrow.
He'll go to the meeting tomorrow.

The main functions of "will" are:

a. to predict a future event:

The party will be at my house at eight o'clock.
The exam will finish in one hour.

b. to express a spontaneous decision:

I'll answer the phone.
You don't have bread! We'll go to the supermarket.

Note the difference between will and going to in this use. We use going to if a decision has been made before speaking, but will if the decision is made now.

John: What are you doing this weekend?
Mary: I'm going to visit Howard in Boston.
John: But Howard is in Chicago this weekend with his parents.
Mary: Oh! I didn't know that! I'll go and visit his brother Stefano then.

In this dialogue, Mary's first answer uses going to as it is a plan she made before. Her second answer uses will as she now has to make a new plan, and her plan to visit Stefano is made now, as she speaks.

c. to express a prediction based on opinion, not on fact.

Howes will win the election.
I think she'll get married next summer.

Here, expressions of opinion and belief are common:

I hope we'll see the start of the film
I wonder what will happen if I press this red button. Aaagh!!
She will probably be very late because of the traffic.
He's sure he'll get the job. He said the interview went quite well.

d. The old form of will, "shall" is often used to make offers and suggestions.

Shall we leave now? It's late.
That bag is very heavy. Shall I help you with it?
