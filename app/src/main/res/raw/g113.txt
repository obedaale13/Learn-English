Get Passive

In English, the passive can always be made using the verb "to be". In informal English, "get" is also often used to construct passive sentences. But it's not always possible.

We use "get" in a passive sentence when we talk about something that happened or something that changed, so it is NOT used for verbs such as 'like', 'believe' or 'say'.

It also changes the focus from "what happened" to "the person/thing something happened to". It's not usual to see a "by" clause saying who did it. Look at the difference between:

The window was broken by those naughty children. (focus on event)
The window got broken. (focus on "window")

Note: It's not normal to use a "by" clause with the "get" passive.
The computer was stolen by a thief. OR The computer got stolen, NOT The computer got stolen by a thief.
