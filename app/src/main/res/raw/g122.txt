"Can" And "Be Able"
These two are both used to talk about ability, but in different ways.

General Ability

I can swim.
I am able to swim.

Both these sentences mean the same thing but "can" is usually used as it is shorter and more concise.

Also in the past, we use "could" instead of "was able to" to talk about general ability.

Mozart could play the piano when he was four years old.
NOT Mozart was able to play the piano when he was four years old.

Remember, it's not wrong - it's just better to use "can" or "could" in these examples.

Specific Ability

If we want to talk about someone's ability to do something at a specific time in the past, we must use "to be able to".

I studied a lot for this exam and I was able to finish it easily.

Here we cannot use "could". This is not a general ability - this exam was only on one day, at a specific time in the past. We can also use other expressions such as "succeeded in" or "managed to" to talk about what someone was able to do at a specific time in the past.

I managed to see John for five minutes when he wasn't busy.
It was a difficult shot but Tiger Woods succeeded in playing it perfectly.



However, even when we are talking about a specific occasion in the past, for negative sentences, we can use "couldn't".

It was a hard exam and I couldn't finish it in time.

As before, using "wasn't able to" in this sentence is possible, but is considered too long.
